## Welcome to John Jenkins's GitHub Page
I have many ongoing and past projects stored in my Github repos. I am using github pages to describe and organize the projects.

### ngArcGauge
ngArcGauge is an angularjs directive that is a [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) arc gauge with alot of custom values. The repo readme.md explains how to setup the project.
